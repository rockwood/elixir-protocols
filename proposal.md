A Practical Guide to Elixir Protocols

Protocols are an important part of the Elixir language, and they play a key role in many of it's
prominent libraries. However, it's not always obvious how and when to use them. In this talk, we'll
see how to leverage the power of protocols to solve real-world problems.

We'll walk through some practical examples and see how protocols can solve a variety of use
cases. We'll start simple and end with some relatively sophisticated scenarios. We'll even dive into
the Elixir source code to see how protocols are implemented on the BEAM. After attending this talk,
you'll have practical understanding of protocols and the use cases they can help solve.
